# Uni Year 3 Facial Expression Recognition
This is a C# project for my 3rd year course at University (passed in 2011) to try to read facial expressions and then send reactions to a Sony AIBO dog if connected.

Uses EmguCV for computer vision, and all DLLs from version 2.1 need to go into the "EmguCV" folder under the solution root (download them from https://sourceforge.net/projects/emgucv/).

Sony AIBO dog not required to make it work, but if it's connected then programs will be sent to it in the R programming language over WiFi.
